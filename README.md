# Gitlab-init

Switch to Gitlab without having to switch away from GitHub!

Initialises an empty repository and registers the *Push to remote repository* feature of GitLab to ensure that any repos you create are mirrored to Github. This lets you use GitLab's amazing CI/CD features while also having an up to date copy on GitHub without having to do any work yourself!
